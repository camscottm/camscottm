	<h4>About Me</h4> 
	<p>&nbsp;My name is Cameron Miller and this is my digital media portfolio. I have gained interest in the area of digital media a lot this past school year. Here you will find all of the major projects I worked on this year. </p>
	<p>I am mainly a musician. I have played piano for 12 years and I self taught myself the bass guitar and normal guitar about 4 years ago. I do a lot of singing as well in my school choirs. I also started my own band, called Lemon Tree Grove, with a couple of friends. We have since recorded and released music onto all major streaming platforms. Despite my huge involvement in music, I wanted to expand my horizons by learning about digital media. &nbsp;</p>
